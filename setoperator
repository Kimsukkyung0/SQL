-- This is a type of operator connecting multiple queries by UNION

-- Through the UNION ALL, the basic function (remove the duplication values) could be allowed and ignored

-- the name of column is lead by the first query , therefore if the developer want to change the name of query should be declared at the first row


-- UNION + Regular expression 
-- Q1 : Find the names started with 'j' or 'd' from both tables 

SELECT A.first_name AS Name , A.last_name AS Last name FROM customer A

-- Q2 : find names with sub-query

-- count(*) has a quite similar function with limit() . same result.
